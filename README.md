    ==========================
    This project, starting in a goal that I could make it work.
and this is my first project. The idea of the project is computer 
vision techniques and soft computing the motion of lips were to be
to produce the audio equivalent of it.
	At the of writting this readme, I do not know anything more
than that I going to use python,openCV,PyBrain(NueralNetwork),PySide
for gui.
	I decided myself to track what I do using git and publish it
using github.
